            <h2>1.2 Network Sovereignty – Intro, CH 1 & 2</h2>
            <p>“Dr. Yellow Horse Brave Heart’s point cannot be understated: to work against colonialism is not simply a matter of protesting the World Trade Organizations, building schools in far-off Indigenous locales, and practicing policy reform. One of the most nefarious dimensions of colonization is how it takes root in the psyche, limiting intellectual vision and poisoning the spirit with defeat by white supremacy.” Page 30.

                This quotes really hit home because this reading, particularly chapter 1 took me through some examinations of colonialism which I had never experienced. 
                
                I grew up in rural New Mexico in a politically left leaning family. As a traveling adult, I’ve come to realize that this upbringing gave me an above average exposure to ideas surrounding colonization. That being said, I’ve never taken it upon myself to examine literature put out by indigenous scholars on the topic. 
                
                One of the most striking points in the reading was for me when the 4 mechanisms for Spanish colonialism were explained. The fourth mechanism, epistemological redistribution, I think is the mechanism which Dr. Yellow Horse Brave Heart’s point is most heavily referencing. This mechanism is what perpetuates the other three mechanisms, and they all strengthen each other in a reinforcing feedback loop. I think this 4th mechanism is an extremely significant catalyst in perpetuating that cycle.
                
                It is this mechanism which has I think led to the delay in my exposure to such literature, despite my engrained awareness that such violent societal histories and current consequences exist. Even if you come from a politically left leaning family, there is white supremacy engrained. It’s staggering to realize how my brain has for so much of my life labeled nonwhite people as “other”. It’s so seemingly normalized. Because other louder obvious forms of racism exist, the examination of one’s own prejudices is easy to pass by.  It’s a pretty vicious cycle to observe and gives me an even greater reverence for the tedious, painful, patient work of Indigenous scholars and activists.
