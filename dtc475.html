             <p>“Dr. Yellow Horse Brave Heart’s point cannot be understated: to work against colonialism is not simply a matter 
                    of protesting the World Trade Organizations, building schools in far-off Indigenous locales, and practicing policy reform. 
                    One of the most nefarious dimensions of colonization is how it takes root in the psyche, limiting intellectual vision and 
                    poisoning the spirit with defeat by white supremacy.” page 30. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This quote really hit home because this reading, particularly chapter 1 took me through some examinations of colonialism 
                    which I had never experienced. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I grew up in rural New Mexico in a politically left leaning family. As a traveling adult, I’ve come to realize that this 
                    upbringing gave me an above average exposure to ideas surrounding colonization. That being said, I’ve never taken it upon 
                    myself to examine literature put out by indigenous scholars on the topic.
                </p>    
                <p>    
                    One of the most striking points in the reading was for me when the 4 mechanisms for Spanish colonialism were explained. 
                    The fourth mechanism, epistemological redistribution, I think is the mechanism which Dr. Yellow Horse Brave Heart’s point 
                    is most heavily referencing. This mechanism is what perpetuates the other three mechanisms, and they all strengthen each 
                    other in a reinforcing feedback loop. I think this 4th mechanism is an extremely significant catalyst in perpetuating that cycle.
                </p>     
                <p>
                    It is this mechanism which has I think led to the delay in my exposure to such literature, despite my engrained awareness 
                    that such violent societal histories and current consequences exist. Even if you come from a politically left leaning family, 
                    there is white supremacy engrained. It’s staggering to realize how my brain has for so much of my life labeled nonwhite people 
                    as “other”. It’s so seemingly normalized. Because other louder obvious forms of racism exist, the examination of one’s own 
                    prejudices is easy to pass by.  It’s a pretty vicious cycle to observe and gives me an even greater reverence for the tedious, 
                    painful, patient work of Indigenous scholars and activists.

                <h4>Pictured above, Washington state overlayed with tribal territories according to the Whose Land app.</h4>
            </div>
                <p>“Thus in the case of tribal broadband deployment, the idea of place-based ways of knowing refers to not only ecological knowledge 
                    and tribal philosophies but also knowledge of the local political, social, economic, and technical terrain. At present there are 
                    more the 568 federally recognized tribes within US boarders. This does not account for tribes that are state-recognized and those 
                    that are unrecognized by federal and state governments yet bear the rights of inherently sovereign Native peoples. In the years to 
                    come, each of these communities – tribes and peoples – will apply broadband access solutions according to its technical capacity, 
                    unique landscapes, and needs. There should be more than 568 solutions to acquiring broadband access in Indian Country.”
                </p>
                <p>This paragraph addressing the heart of the problem with living in a highly dynamic and networked society. Reductive modeling has 
                    induced leaps of technological progress over centuries. In those reductions, costs for such progress were measured reductively and
                    according to convenience of those in power. 
                </p>
                <p>The author propositions their readers in this paragraph to engage with complexity in problem solving. In my opinion, this a tactic 
                    to propel us toward social progress. It’s painstaking and goes against the status quo to propose more than 568 solutions to attaining 
                    broadband access on tribal land. This however is necessary due to the glaring harm reductionist tactics have rippled through society 
                    for generations.
                </p>
                <p>This proposition also urges readers to consider each tribe truly as a sovereign nation. I think something I can certainly take away 
                    from this reading in my personal views is that understanding that I had been taking on a reductionist view of rolling all the indigenous 
                    peoples within the US borders into one category in my mind. The institution of federal government stood as one entity, and the indigenous 
                    tribes have been standing as one entity, and those two would be inherently in oppositional dualism. In reading about the layers of 
                    sovereignty of each tribe, a multitude of new vectors have been revealed.

                <h4>A <a href="https://brewminate.com/the-impact-of-the-transcontinental-railroad-on-native-americans/">Native American</a> man looking at 
                    the Central Pacific Railroad, about 1869. Courtesy of Library of Congress.</h4>
            </div>
            
                <p>“Second, we have to acknowledge that the US history of the colonization of Native lands, bodies, and waters has shaped the ability of Native 
                    peoples to socially organize and communicate. Armed with a sacrosanct belief in the correlation between moral progress, private property, 
                    and technological advance, settlers purveyed public and Christian schooling, surveyors’ tolls and mapmaking, dam construction, telegraph 
                    communications, agricultural work, factory work, and the internal combustion engine as means of settling indigenous lands, waters, bodies 
                    in the Americas.” p 110 
                </p>
                <p>Manifest Destiny and railroad expansion are not taught in the context of indigenous suffering. This really struck me how I recall westward 
                    expansion in the US being painted as a near holy endeavor. Imagine how this would taught in a sci-fi society where the oppressed are the 
                    writers of history. How would that affect the behavior of those in power, as a mirror? 
                </p>  
                <p>I’ve known that I’ve been engrained with racism, and racist perspectives, along with other prejudices. It’s a modern baseline of self-
                    awareness to examine one’s happenstantial place in society and understand how that place came to be. I feel practiced at it. Nonetheless, 
                    the book has accomplished what it set out to do and communicated the perspectives of many oppressed groups under American colonialism, and 
                    I stand surprised at the notions which had not yet occurred to me. The meaning and link between westward expansion and the industrial 
                    revolution and the oppression of indigenous groups in North American had not been made so clearly before reading this book.
                </p>
                <p>I can’t help but wonder what it must have felt like to be the families who were pushed off their land for the expansion of the railroad, 
                    only to watch a few decades later it go into near total disuse.
