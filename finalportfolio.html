                <h4>Pictured above, Washington state overlayed with tribal territories according to the Whose Land app.</h4>
            </div>
                <p>“Thus in the case of tribal broadband deployment, the idea of place-based ways of knowing refers to not only ecological knowledge 
                    and tribal philosophies but also knowledge of the local political, social, economic, and technical terrain. At present there are 
                    more the 568 federally recognized tribes within US boarders. This does not account for tribes that are state-recognized and those 
                    that are unrecognized by federal and state governments yet bear the rights of inherently sovereign Native peoples. In the years to 
                    come, each of these communities – tribes and peoples – will apply broadband access solutions according to its technical capacity, 
                    unique landscapes, and needs. There should be more than 568 solutions to acquiring broadband access in Indian Country.”
                </p>
                <p>This paragraph addressing the heart of the problem with living in a highly dynamic and networked society. Reductive modeling has 
                    induced leaps of technological progress over centuries. In those reductions, costs for such progress were measured reductively and
                    according to convenience of those in power. 
                </p>
                <p>The author propositions their readers in this paragraph to engage with complexity in problem solving. In my opinion, this a tactic 
                    to propel us toward social progress. It’s painstaking and goes against the status quo to propose more than 568 solutions to attaining 
                    broadband access on tribal land. This however is necessary due to the glaring harm reductionist tactics have rippled through society 
                    for generations.
                </p>
                <p>This proposition also urges readers to consider each tribe truly as a sovereign nation. I think something I can certainly take away 
                    from this reading in my personal views is that understanding that I had been taking on a reductionist view of rolling all the indigenous 
                    peoples within the US borders into one category in my mind. The institution of federal government stood as one entity, and the indigenous 
                    tribes have been standing as one entity, and those two would be inherently in oppositional dualism. In reading about the layers of 
                    sovereignty of each tribe, a multitude of new vectors have been revealed.

            <h2>Race after Technology – Intro, CH 1</h2>
            <div id="vervecke">
                <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N_CKFZ3ffKpNoX2di27xYKppQREIryhR/view"><img src="racial-classifications.jpg" target="_blank"></a>
                <h4>Colonial Brazil's racial caste system.</h4>
            </div>
             <p>One of the main ideas Benjamin gets at in the introduction is the idea of race as technology. I was recently introduced to the idea of “psycho-technologies” 
                by John Vervecke. In his interviews with Jim Rutt, he describes the lens of viewing the act of listening as a psycho-technology because of the effect it can 
                have on another person feeling heard. I had been using the term in a pretty rosey utopian way. Benjamin offers, I think, the same or very similar lens but 
                applied to race and reveals a wholistic sphere of the implications of a psycho-technology. This lens is revelatory and I think forces a greater sense of 
                compassion because it asks us to consider what is the psychological effect of growing up with the notion of race and racism. I’m a white cis woman which is very 
                conformist to status quo. I think one of the most difficult parts of overcoming notions of racism in broad society is that the status quo has to realize the 
                validity of other standpoints, which for some people can be really difficult, unimaginable, or even offensive. Enter white fragility. On a personal level, just
                within my social circles, not even bringing up broader topics like racism, it has been revelatory; the maturity and fearless required to admit and be 
                accountable for one’s sense of entitlement, it’s been one hell of a wake up call which I am ever grateful for. It has allowed me to be a better friend, partner, 
                and neighbor. Scaling this notion up on the basis of understanding race as a socio-psycho technology I think is a step towards people being able to reframe and 
                hear another side.  Once we can hear each other, we can heal each other.

                <p>“Second, we have to acknowledge that the US history of the colonization of Native lands, bodies, and waters has shaped the ability of Native 
                    peoples to socially organize and communicate. Armed with a sacrosanct belief in the correlation between moral progress, private property, 
                    and technological advance, settlers purveyed public and Christian schooling, surveyors’ tolls and mapmaking, dam construction, telegraph 
                    communications, agricultural work, factory work, and the internal combustion engine as means of settling indigenous lands, waters, bodies 
                    in the Americas.” p 110 
                </p>
                <p>Manifest Destiny and railroad expansion are not taught in the context of indigenous suffering. This really struck me how I recall westward 
                    expansion in the US being painted as a near holy endeavor. Imagine how this would taught in a sci-fi society where the oppressed are the 
                    writers of history. How would that affect the behavior of those in power, as a mirror? 
                </p>  
                <p>I’ve known that I’ve been engrained with racism, and racist perspectives, along with other prejudices. It’s a modern baseline of self-
                    awareness to examine one’s happenstantial place in society and understand how that place came to be. I feel practiced at it. Nonetheless, 
                    the book has accomplished what it set out to do and communicated the perspectives of many oppressed groups under American colonialism, and 
                    I stand surprised at the notions which had not yet occurred to me. The meaning and link between westward expansion and the industrial 
                    revolution and the oppression of indigenous groups in North American had not been made so clearly before reading this book.
                </p>
                <p>I can’t help but wonder what it must have felt like to be the families who were pushed off their land for the expansion of the railroad, 
                    only to watch a few decades later it go into near total disuse.

                <p>The intersection between sovereignty, complexity, and race as a psychotechnology refers to the ways in which these three concepts interact and influence each other to shape our understanding of power, identity, and agency. In this synthesis report, we will explore the key ideas and arguments related to this intersection and examine how they inform our understanding of social dynamics and cultural identity.
                </p>

                <p>Sovereignty refers to the concept of political power and authority, and the right of a state or other entity to exercise control over its own territory and people. It is often associated with ideas of autonomy, independence, and self-determination, and is viewed as a fundamental aspect of national and individual identity. However, sovereignty is not a fixed or static concept, and is constantly evolving in response to changing social, political, and economic conditions.
                </p>

                <p>Complexity, on the other hand, refers to the interconnectedness and interdependence of social systems, and the ways in which they are shaped by multiple factors, such as culture, history, and technology. It is often used to describe the intricate and dynamic relationships between different actors and institutions, and the ways in which these relationships can create new forms of power and influence.
                </p>

                <p>Race as a psychotechnology refers to the ways in which race is constructed and mediated through various social, cultural, and technological systems, and how these systems shape our perceptions of identity, power, and agency. It highlights the ways in which race is not a fixed or natural category but is instead a product of complex social and historical processes that are constantly evolving and changing.
                </p>
                
                <p>At the intersection of sovereignty, complexity, and race as a psychotechnology, we can see the ways in which these three concepts interact and shape each other to create a complex web of power, identity, and agency. For example, the concept of sovereignty can be used to justify racial exclusion, by defining certain groups of people as "outsiders" or of the state, as is true for the First Nations in North America. This exclusionary step is seen as necessary to establishing boundary between the colonized United States, and those indigenous nations which have managed to sustain self-preservation. A complex system of power and control remains nonetheless which is reinforced by cultural norms and institutional practices and can have a profound impact on the lives of people of color.
                </p>

                <p>Similarly, the concept of complexity can be used to challenge existing power structures and create new forms of agency and influence for marginalized communities. For example, social media platforms and other forms of digital technology have created new channels of communication and interaction that have allowed marginalized communities to connect and in an exchange of experience and ideas. This generated community despite geographic distance empowered marginalized groups to mobilize and enact change in various formats according to their unique disposition. However, these same technologies can also be used to reinforce existing power structures and perpetuate forms of oppression and discrimination, particularly for marginalized groups who may not have equal access to these tools, nor the equal representation in the development of such tools.
                </p>

                <p>The concept of race as a psychotechnology further complicates this intersection by highlighting the ways in which race is perpetuated by both in-groups and out-groups, in harmful and in empowering ways. Groups identifying with racial categories empowers the ingroup via shared experience in discrimination, while simultaneously reinforcing the validity of concept of race in society. This includes the ways in which racial categories are created and reinforced through media representations, institutional practices, and everyday interactions. The common goal of in-group formations is to diminish harmful racial stereotypes. For example, racial stereotypes and biases can be perpetuated through the use of facial recognition technology, which has been shown to be less accurate for people with darker skin tones.
                </p>

                <p>Overall, the intersection between sovereignty, complexity, and race as a psychotechnology is complex and multifaceted, and requires a nuanced understanding of the ways in which these concepts interact and influence each other. It highlights the importance of recognizing the historical and cultural factors that shape our understanding of power, identity, and agency, and the ways in which these factors can perpetuate forms of discrimination and oppression. It also underscores the need for critical engagement with technology and other forms of cultural production, in order to ensure that they are used in ways that promote equity, justice, and human dignity for all.
