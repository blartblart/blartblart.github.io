                <h3>Loneliness of Gods  </h3>    
                <p>In one of the more recent classes, there was an ice-breaker-esque question posed about what our interests in XR are. This article is articulating that for me, though I’m not sure I totally realized it until just now.</p>
                <p>When my husband and I first met, we fell in love at what I can only describe as break-neck speed. It was visceral. It was intense. It gave me cause to refer to the act of falling in love from then onwards as “getting high on love drugs”. We were spending time together asking questions like what does art of the future look like? We read sci-fi novels together and would fantasize about our own roles and reactions in the scenarios they presented. One of the by-products of that time is the title of this site which appears on the browser tab “Loser Art”, a literary idea we had (have?) to create all these futuristic art projects in literature, influenced also by the writings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges">Louis Borges.</a> It’s a loser art because we could only fashion those ideas into creation by descriptions, not in physical reality. Only gods get to make their visions come alive in the meat space. Losers must resort to the lesser realms of literature, or worse, visual arts. We were laughing at ourselves and feeling sorry for the loneliness of gods.</p>
                <p>Another byproduct was a catch phrase we would find ourselves saying to each other in moments of realization that we were both aware of and experiencing awe, living in an extraordinary circumstance of simply being alive. We would catch each other’s eye and say, “nice design”. This was a reference to a fantasy we described to each other once. There is a philosophical theory called the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnl6nY8YKHs">simulation hypothesis</a> (popularized by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom">Nick Bostrom</a> in recent times) which proposes that our reality is simulated. My husband and I imagined we were two beings who designed this space together and are going through the trials and tribulations we’ve set in front of one another in an ever-emerging game; life as a video game.</p>
                <p>I won’t go into any gory detail, but as high-speed as we fell in love, so did the walls come crashing down around us. In these, our relationship was hanging by a thread. We even admitted to each other at times that the only reason we were still together was because we said we would be. It was grim to say the least. Our gorgeous fantasizing and playful inquiries subsided, and we were grinding through life, living through a relatively loveless marriage, because we said we would. </p>
                <p>During this period, I suffered from long spans of depression. During one such time, when we were undergoing a more or less disconnected period, I recall a moment where, sitting across from one another in the living room with our friends on New Year’s, my spouse and I caught each other’s eyes. For some magic reason, we held each other’s gaze. It felt like seeing each other again for the first time after months of living under a deathly zombie curse which caused us to breeze past each other as mere ghosts. I began to tear up, feeling a trickle of something for him which I had forgotten about; some shadow of a shimmering and tender love unearthed like a hint of a seashell poking out suddenly from the sand washed in the retreat of a wave. He came over to me, grasped my hand and whispered close to my ear “nice design”, an utterance which at that point had not been around for years.</p>
                <p>It felt like glass shattering in my head. When I think back on this moment, I can hear it play in my head, the sound of brittle shards exploding apart and hitting the floor in slow motion. These two words broke some kind of curse I had put myself under. I had lost touch with the parts of me which knew how to be joyful. I was so hopeless I hadn’t realized how hopeless I had become. He reminded me how fun life had been in a flash flood of memories; how integral play had been in our initial attraction to each other. It was transformational. </p>
                <p>I don’t want to leave any readers with the impression that it was smooth sailing from that moment on. It, without a doubt, was not. It took years after that moment to get to a place where we both agreed that our mutual respect, trust, and a default loving-kindness foundation was felt. But this is the moment and the mindset which we would fashion into a tool to remind each other of what had been and what is possible; in living within ourselves and in each other. </p>
                <p>The big takeaway from this article which I am scaling up into what feels like an ever-expanding crisis of meaning experienced in society, is that we can say yes to the world which we find ourselves immersed in and choose to play in that game intentionally, joyfully, rather than feel as though the game (life) is happening at or to us. I’m sort of laughing at how trite that sounds, but I’m somewhat enthralled by this article and the idea that healing our relationships to reality can happen in XR. </p>
                <p><em>“Even at the most basic levels of interactivity, immersive experiences grant the audience a degree of agency, and <strong>when one has the ability to change the environment around them, one has the potential to be changed.</strong>”</em> What we are immersed in is happening to us right now and we each hold the potential to possess the agency to influence it, not as lonely gods, but at mermaids. As one friend put it once, it is the taking of responsibility for one’s own life. This is what I want from XR. I want it to inspire people into the mindset that we can seize the experience of living, exist in a conversation of influence with reality. Hurdles become quests; people become team-mates; life as a videogame experience which we have opted into participating in the design of. </p>

                <h3>Sarah Bernhardt's Story</h3>
                <img class="journal" src="338img/bernhardt.jpg">
                <p>I want to tell the story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Bernhardt" target="_blank">Sarah Barnhardt</a>, or at least part of her story. I like the idea of bringing “the world’s first celebrity” into a 3D digital storytelling space. Also, her life is interesting and took place during the industrial revolution, a time which I think bares some comparisons to the present moment in how we move forward with AI and looming climate change. There was significant cultural anxiety of that time, as portrayed in Edvard Munch’s painting The Scream, about the pace of technological development and change. I think society the world over feels this anxiety in the information era, not just towards technological changes, but also climate changes (arguably a direct result of the industrial revolution). I think Sarah Barnhardt, the naturalist aesthetics of Art Nouveau and these anxious themes would resonate with contemporary culture.</p>
