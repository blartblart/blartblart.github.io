             <p>One of the main ideas Benjamin gets at in the introduction is the idea of race as technology. I was recently introduced to the idea of “psycho-technologies” 
                by John Vervecke. In his interviews with Jim Rutt, he describes the lens of viewing the act of listening as a psycho-technology because of the effect it can 
                have on another person feeling heard. I had been using the term in a pretty rosey utopian way. Benjamin offers, I think, the same or very similar lens but 
                applied to race and reveals a wholistic sphere of the implications of a psycho-technology. This lens is revelatory and I think forces a greater sense of 
                compassion because it asks us to consider what is the psychological effect of growing up with the notion of race and racism. I’m a white cis woman which is very 
                conformist to status quo. I think one of the most difficult parts of overcoming notions of racism in broad society is that the status quo has to realize the 
                validity of other standpoints, which for some people can be really difficult, unimaginable, or even offensive. Enter white fragility. On a personal level, just
                 within my social circles, not even bringing up broader topics like racism, it has been revelatory; the maturity and fearless required to admit and be 
                 accountable for one’s sense of entitlement, it’s been one hell of a wake up call which I am ever grateful for. It has allowed me to be a better friend, partner, 
                 and neighbor. Scaling this notion up on the basis of understanding race as a socio-psycho technology I think is a step towards people being able to reframe and 
                 hear another side.  Once we can hear each other, we can heal each other.

                <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hot-thought/202301/what-systemic-racism-is-and-how-to-overcome-it"><img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/women/2015/11/13/matrix-neo-red-pill_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.jpg?imwidth=450" target="_blank"></a>
                <h4>Taking the "red pill" should still stand for making choices which would reveal the etirety of a system, for better or worse, and not for the far right's fagile fears of what a more level playing field would look like.</h4>

             <p>“The [Matrix’s] use of déjà vu is helpful for considering the relationship between seemingly trivial technical glitches and meaningful design decisions.’ 
                I love the Matrix and I love that the author draws from it as a theme throughout chapter 2. She goes on to describe that in the movie and in society, perhaps a 
                glitch which is being labeled as more or less inconsequential, it could rather be regarded as a signal of something to come, perhaps something sinister. 

                I think pervasive attitudes of dismissiveness signal danger in our contemporary American culture. When an oppressed class has critiqued one in power, it is more
                 often than not met with dismissiveness because examination could lead to exposure and accountability, which is painful and can lead to loss of power. On a small scale, 
                 when I have been critiqued in my behavior by my partner or a close friend, if I meet them with a “yes, and” mentality rather than one of defensiveness, I usually find 
                 that the truth can be untangled from our mutual web of biases and entangle standpoints. This process can be humbling and painful to assess and admit to being a “bad person” 
                 but it’s the first step to healing whatever starting place was generating an anti-social behavior in the first place. Scaling this ups to society is no small feat because the 
                 entity which must take accountability for perpetuating such glitches must willing to, at a societal scale, humble itself. 
                
                I commend each patient framework which has been built from the standpoint of the oppressed. We must make cognitive choices to overcome glitches in our system. 
                It’s the chance that humans have. The image is Neo because I resent the movie being so heavily co-opted in rhetoric which reinforces oppressed systems.
