             <p>One of the main ideas Benjamin gets at in the introduction is the idea of race as technology. I was recently introduced to the idea of “psycho-technologies” 
                by John Vervecke. In his interviews with Jim Rutt, he describes the lens of viewing the act of listening as a psycho-technology because of the effect it can 
                have on another person feeling heard. I had been using the term in a pretty rosey utopian way. Benjamin offers, I think, the same or very similar lens but 
                applied to race and reveals a wholistic sphere of the implications of a psycho-technology. This lens is revelatory and I think forces a greater sense of 
                compassion because it asks us to consider what is the psychological effect of growing up with the notion of race and racism. I’m a white cis woman which is very 
                conformist to status quo. I think one of the most difficult parts of overcoming notions of racism in broad society is that the status quo has to realize the 
                validity of other standpoints, which for some people can be really difficult, unimaginable, or even offensive. Enter white fragility. On a personal level, just
                 within my social circles, not even bringing up broader topics like racism, it has been revelatory; the maturity and fearless required to admit and be 
                 accountable for one’s sense of entitlement, it’s been one hell of a wake up call which I am ever grateful for. It has allowed me to be a better friend, partner, 
                 and neighbor. Scaling this notion up on the basis of understanding race as a socio-psycho technology I think is a step towards people being able to reframe and 
                 hear another side.  Once we can hear each other, we can heal each other.
