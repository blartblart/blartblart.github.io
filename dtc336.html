            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>Sella's is a staple restaurant in Pullman, found just below the Washington State University campus. The building is 80's retro with beautiful views of the small town,
            furbished with big windows, a small outdoor deck, and lovely homemade family friendly aesthetic. We set out to give Sella's branding a modern update while still keeping in touch with these initial 
            small town vibes. We also wanted to give Sell's an update which would stand the test of time, giving the brand longevity in a quickly changing world.
            </p>
            <p>We both decided worked on color scheme and font choices. I worked on the typographic logo and menu design and layout, while Lillian focused on development of characters, geometric shapes, packaging, and t-shirts.</p>

            <h2>Why the update?</h2>
            <p>We felt Sell's original logo had a lot of heart and showcased a mom & pop design. After speaking with the owner, we discovered their logo and menu design
            had in fact been a family affair designed partially by hand and partially digitally by the owner's nephew. While we love a family endevour, the typographic logo
            feature a generic script typface and lacked an identity which was unique to the restaurant. Additionally, the menu had some layout issues, including a misuse of 
            negative space, crowding of information, and slew of different typfaces. Addtiionally, they had these cute characters which looked a little dated and faded in their
            original hand-drawn format. The color pallette also paid ommage to the university, but also boxed them into an over simplistic color pallette, again lacking in a 
            Sella's specific feeling.
            </p>

            <h2>The direction we chose...</h2>
            <p>We dicided we wanted to play on the fact that this place is first and foremost, italian cuisine. Because of the family friendly vibes, and 80's retro shape of the 
                building, we began our initial designs with inspiration from Memphis design, orinating in Milano, Italy. This naturally guided us towards simply geometric shapes and 
                a slight variation on a primary color palette. Bold black lines accompanies our designs in large part due to the typeface we chose for the logo. Stone Cold Fox is a 
                retro font which has some playfulness to which is nostalgic, but also somewhat retro digital as is resembles the Sega gamesystem typeface. This also touched on another
                theme we noticed in Sella's which was their passhion of local sports teams. Finally, we wanted to incorporate the family friendly aspect even more by including a kids 
                section featuring a revamp of their cartoon mascots, Cal the Calzone, Piezano the pizza slice, and Twisty the twisted breadstick. These now vectorized characters are featured
                on variations of the company's t-shirts, and pizza boxes. Calling back to the simple shapes we bagan with, each character is represtend in a simple shape pattern which
                is again calling to the Memphis design we kicked off with.
