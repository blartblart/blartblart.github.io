                <p>Please join us in celebrating the love and lives of these people, and their creation of new humans; humans who will soon enter our lives and forever change them. Let us festively rejoice in the occassion over food, games, and merriment aplenty.</p>
                <p>This is an all gender and all ages event. Bring your great uncle, we'd love to meet them.</p>
                <p>Bauhaus will be providing some refreshments of the omnivorous and vegitarian variety. Please feel free to bring anything additional you'd like. This is a BYOB event so please plan your consumption accordingly. Keep in mind, however, that the event will conclude in the early afternoon at 4pm.</p>
                <p>We ask that our friends leave their dogs at home or at their hotel for this event. It will be a particularly full house and we are trying, as always, to contain the chaos as much as possible. We love your dogs and appreciate their sacrifice.</p>

                <p><strong>The greatest gift is your presence. Period.</strong></p>
                <p>Beyond that, if you would like to give a gift, links to registries are provided below. Just click the button of the mom you're intending to shop for. If you're someone with second hand baby items you'd like to give like clothes, books, or toys, those make great gifts as well! This is a reduce/reuse/recycle friendly baby shower.  </p>

                <p>Please feel free to utilize the registry of the mom(s)-to-be with whom you are close to. There is no expectation that if a gift is bought for one mom that a gift must be bought for the other.</p>
                <p>Additionally, for those who so desire to bring gifts, <strong><em>DIAPERS</em></strong> make a wonderful gift. For those electing to give diapers, it is recommended to get a larger (older) size because newborn diapers will be suitable for a very brief window.</p>
                <p>Still wanting to give but not sure what? In this economy? Consider giving the gift of cash. </p>
