                <p>Prior to the development of writing systems, information-sharing and storytelling happened primarily through the spoken word. The advent of printing arguably facilitated the democratization of the written word but books could still be expensive items to own. In our time, media consumption can be expensive. For instance, going to a movie can end up costing $20-30 per person. Streaming media requires subscriptions and to get the stories we crave, we sometimes have to purchase multiple subscriptions.</p> 
                <p>Are our storytelling media now luxury items? Please address this question in your writing this week. Aim for an entry that is about 350-500 words. </p>
                <p>You might address:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The effects of mass adoption of subscriptions for media consumption</li>
                        <li>The history of how television, radio, games, and movies used to be distributed</li>
                        <li>Who is advantaged in this structure</li>
                        <li>What this structure means for independent producers</li>
                        <li>How this alters public discourse</li>
                        <li>Alternative ways we get our shared stories</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>“The advent of printing arguably facilitated the democratization of the written word, but books could still be expensive items to own.” I would tweak this statement and say that printing facilitated the democratization and proliferation of information. The reason communication exists in the first place comes from a desire to share information. Printing is a tool of information sharing. As with many tools, I think there is a spectrum of efficiency and effectiveness. I can dig a larger hole faster with an excavator than I can manually with a shovel. </p>
                <p>Storytelling media are not exclusively now luxury items, as “storytelling media” is a broad category with a spectrum of tools which could fit inside of it. I would say that some of the tools on this spectrum do constitute luxury items for many. Elon Musk’s ability to capture and moderate and censor the biggest open forum in history is a luxury few can afford. Some mediums are luxury items depending on how we are constructing our definitions of wealth and luxury. For example, according to 
                <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$model$markers$mountain$data$filter$dimensions$geo$un_state:true;;;;&encoding$order$data$concept:null&constant=none;&direction=asc;&selected$data$filter$markers@=africa&=americas&=asia&=europe&=usa;;;;&facet_row$data$constant=none;;;;&billy$encoding$selected$data$;;;;;;&chart-type=mountain&url=v1" target="_blank">Gap Minder</a>, the United States population exists exclusively above the “extreme poverty” line. It can be assumed that this means most of the population (with exceptions especially as it pertains to rural indigenous communities) has access to the internet. Having a free Facebook, YouTube, or Twitter account on which to consume media is possible for most in this context, which would imply they are not luxury items. Expanding this question beyond American borders to populations in Africa, Asia, and South America changes the context of the definition of luxury and would probably qualify internet access as a luxury item, and the United States as a luxurious country.</p>
                <img class="journal" alt="a chart from Gap Minder depicting global income comparisons with the US portion highlighted" href="https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$model$markers$mountain$data$filter$dimensions$geo$un_state:true;;;;&encoding$order$data$concept:null&constant=none;&direction=asc;&selected$data$filter$markers@=africa&=americas&=asia&=europe&=usa;;;;&facet_row$data$constant=none;;;;&billy$encoding$selected$data$;;;;;;&chart-type=mountain&url=v1" src="375img/gapminder-income.png" target="_blank">
                <p>Honing this discussion in on just the US population, I think an information-privilege reinforcing feedback loop is likely occurring. Each platform now tends to offer a subscription version of their media. This creates a privilege of information among those with more resources, and information can lead to improved methods of resource collection. Often, time is a factor as well; those with subscriptions can access more information, earlier. If I want to watch a movie from Disney, I can probably find it on Disney+ by paying a monthly fee. If I can’t afford that, I can try to pirate it, or rent it for a one-time fee on Amazon which takes time and the cost of my time.</p>    
                <p>So, higher quality and more efficient information is possible for a price. If you’re unable to pay that price, some version of that information is probably out there, but the time and energy needed to find it comes at a higher cost; an excavator compared to a shovel.</p>
