                <p>To investigate my relationship to social media, I decided to start at the beginning. My first social media was Myspace probably, around 2005. It was the first time I understood anything about web design tools like HTML. I really liked changing and updating my page in different color schemes and choosing new music to add to the atmosphere. I was 15 or so at the time, which is also a prime age for social development, I think. One of the features of Myspace was a ranked friend list which appeared on your page. This signaled who was who to whom. There was also a feature which allowed you to customize your username which was another way to flash aesthetic value and virtue signal, though I was not aware of all of this at the time. I wish I could remember exactly how Myspace faded out of fashion for me, but I cannot. My assumption is that other people I knew started using it less, so the social value disintegrated. Writing this investigation gave me cause to look into whether or not a simulator exists, and I found one. Feel free to friend me.</p>
                <p>After that, around 2008, one of my friends forced me to get a Facebook profile. By force I mean she set my profile up for me while I laid on her bed not even looking at the computer and answering the profile questions like a personality quiz. At the time I had heard of Facebook but thought it was not open to general public, that it was only for university students. Carly was going to UNM, and I was finishing my senior year of high school. She told me the company had just announced that they were opening account access to the general population and were no longer requiring users to have university affiliated email addresses. It too was different than what we see today. I remember not using it much at first because I didn’t find it to be as much fun. You can’t design your page? I also didn’t have a lot of friends who used it. What simple times.</p>
                <p>In 2010 I moved away, far away, to another continent. In those times I used Skype. It was new and exciting, and I used it a lot to keep in touch with my family and select few friends. But it was kinda too removed from everyone. You had to coordinate quite a lot a make a time to meet. This was when I really started using my Facebook more. It was also more popular with the European friends I was making. They would organize events like birthday parties and the information of where and when was all on Facebook.</p>
                <p>A year later was when I got my first smart phone. It was a full screen with wireless data, and I could check the Facebook app while on public transport. This was before infinite scroll was a feature though so you would always reach the end of the day’s events rather quickly. I think at this time my relationship to social media was pretty wholesome, partially because my feed was a more or less contained network of only people I knew. There were also no ads. </p>
                <p>In 2013 when I moved back to US, Facebook was a full-blown addiction, and I was using it to constantly keep in touch people. I used the chat function to stay connected to the people I had met abroad. The local art scene back home was organized on Facebook. Every house show, gallery opening, open mic night was advertised via events pages on Facebook. I think this is also around the time the “social media manager” as a job title started popping up more. Even the dive bar down the street had a Facebook page. </p>
                <p>This was also around the time I got an Instagram. Again, it was at the behest of one of my friends though this time I was more willing. It had been around for a while but for a long time was only available to iPhone users. By 2014 it didn’t matter though because I got my first iPhone, an iPhone 5. My first few posts on Instagram are pretty lack luster. I was trying to figure out I think what the platform was for. It operated so differently than Facebook. It was image based and that was very different than Myspace or Facebook at that time. </p>
                <p>A couple years later, stuff was getting more interesting. I was posting little scenes, slices of my life. I think social media helped me realized my eyes as cameras and that the camera in my phone allowed me capture and share what I was seeing and the atmosphere there. The word “influencer” was out there, shaping how everyone viewed social media and where it was going. It was around this time when I noticed that I was mindlessly opening the Facebook app on my phone. In response I deleted it. But the same was happening with Instagram.</p>
                <p>Over the next few years, I phased Facebook out almost entirely. I was living for IG though. Up until recently, this was the pattern. I watched the Social Dilemma when it came out and it brought to my attention even more loudly something I was already noticing. This thing was sucking my attention.</p>
                <p>My current relationship with social media can be broken into what I think is good, and what I think is bad. </p>
                <p>What I think is bad is the induced cultural crisis of psychological and emotional wellbeing in the following ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>induced attention deficiencies in people</li>
                        <li>created narcissistic tendencies</li>
                        <li>escalated a crisis of meaning</li>
                        <li>deepened a pre-existing confusion between “being” and “having”</li>
                        <li>generated networks of cultural influence the likes of which had never been seen before</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>What I think is good about it:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>furthering of democratized information</li>
                        <li>generated networks of cultural influence the likes of which had never been seen before</li>
                        <li>I think it has made some people, a fucking lot of people, feel less alone.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Start to finish, the social media journey brought me a lot of joy. Being a young adult in the throughs of such a powerful network emergence and having little to no idea of the breadth of that beast is exciting and I feel like a whole story can be written about that. What is the most suitable character archetype to tell the story of someone living during immense social upheaval and technological development?</p>
                <p>As of now, I have an app on my phone which locks me out of Instagram during the weekdays so that I don’t get sucked in. The positives outweigh the negatives more and more. Maybe it’s my age. I’ve also resisted (wisely, in my opinion) getting a TikTok account. I feel myself wanting more and more to create things, not look at what other people are creating. It’s a shame because it is still a place to connect, but again, as I get older, the more I find myself maxed out by my relationships. I feel like I struggle to have enough time to myself and to put towards undirected play. Everything is so structured lately between school and work and my familial obligations, I find it hard to imagine social media being something that is truly feeding my soul. So, I think what I’m saying is that I feel like I’m in a state of twilight with it. It’s not disappeared completely, but it’s on the back burner with great intention. Like I said, maybe it’s age related but I don’t feel compelled to share every bit of my life with the world anymore. I have been working for decades now to release myself from seeking validation. Social media really exploited that. I’m ready to expand the part of me I’ve cultivated which is sustainable self-assurance.</p>

            <h2>Week 3 Journal 9/4/2023</h2>
            <div class="prompt">
                <p style="font-family: 'Hind', sans-serif;">PROMPT:</p>
                <p>Prior to the development of writing systems, information-sharing and storytelling happened primarily through the spoken word. The advent of printing arguably facilitated the democratization of the written word but books could still be expensive items to own. In our time, media consumption can be expensive. For instance, going to a movie can end up costing $20-30 per person. Streaming media requires subscriptions and to get the stories we crave, we sometimes have to purchase multiple subscriptions.</p> 
                <p>Are our storytelling media now luxury items? Please address this question in your writing this week. Aim for an entry that is about 350-500 words. </p>
                <p>You might address:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The effects of mass adoption of subscriptions for media consumption</li>
                        <li>The history of how television, radio, games, and movies used to be distributed</li>
                        <li>Who is advantaged in this structure</li>
                        <li>What this structure means for independent producers</li>
                        <li>How this alters public discourse</li>
                        <li>Alternative ways we get our shared stories</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>As always, please feel free to use social media for distribution but add a link here and share your script. Your texts can include video, images, links to other media, etc.</p>

                <p>“The advent of printing arguably facilitated the democratization of the written word, but books could still be expensive items to own.” I would tweak this statement and say that printing facilitated the democratization and proliferation of information. The reason communication exists in the first place comes from a desire to share information. Printing is a tool of information sharing. As with many tools, I think there is a spectrum of efficiency and effectiveness. I can dig a larger hole faster with an excavator than I can manually with a shovel. </p>
                <p>Storytelling media are not exclusively now luxury items, as “storytelling media” is a broad category with a spectrum of tools which could fit inside of it. I would say that some of the tools on this spectrum do constitute luxury items for many. Elon Musk’s ability to capture and moderate and censor the biggest open forum in history is a luxury few can afford. Some mediums are luxury items depending on how we are constructing our definitions of wealth and luxury. For example, according to 
                <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$model$markers$mountain$data$filter$dimensions$geo$un_state:true;;;;&encoding$order$data$concept:null&constant=none;&direction=asc;&selected$data$filter$markers@=africa&=americas&=asia&=europe&=usa;;;;&facet_row$data$constant=none;;;;&billy$encoding$selected$data$;;;;;;&chart-type=mountain&url=v1" target="_blank">Gap Minder</a>, the United States population exists exclusively above the “extreme poverty” line. It can be assumed that this means most of the population (with exceptions especially as it pertains to rural indigenous communities) has access to the internet. Having a free Facebook, YouTube, or Twitter account on which to consume media is possible for most in this context, which would imply they are not luxury items. Expanding this question beyond American borders to populations in Africa, Asia, and South America changes the context of the definition of luxury and would probably qualify internet access as a luxury item, and the United States as a luxurious country.</p>
                <img class="journal" alt="a chart from Gap Minder depicting global income comparisons with the US portion highlighted" href="https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$model$markers$mountain$data$filter$dimensions$geo$un_state:true;;;;&encoding$order$data$concept:null&constant=none;&direction=asc;&selected$data$filter$markers@=africa&=americas&=asia&=europe&=usa;;;;&facet_row$data$constant=none;;;;&billy$encoding$selected$data$;;;;;;&chart-type=mountain&url=v1" src="375img/gapminder-income.png" target="_blank">
                <p>Honing this discussion in on just the US population, I think an information-privilege reinforcing feedback loop is likely occurring. Each platform now tends to offer a subscription version of their media. This creates a privilege of information among those with more resources, and information can lead to improved methods of resource collection. Often, time is a factor as well; those with subscriptions can access more information, earlier. If I want to watch a movie from Disney, I can probably find it on Disney+ by paying a monthly fee. If I can’t afford that, I can try to pirate it, or rent it for a one-time fee on Amazon which takes time and the cost of my time.</p>    
                <p>So, higher quality and more efficient information is possible for a price. If you’re unable to pay that price, some version of that information is probably out there, but the time and energy needed to find it comes at a higher cost; an excavator compared to a shovel.</p>
