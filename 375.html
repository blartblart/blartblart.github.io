                <p>Stories are often about conflict and change.  To understand our characters we sometimes need to understand ourselves: our motivations, our desires, our actions.</p> 
                <p>For your last project, you will create a multi-modal piece of writing to tell us an autobiographical story. It should be about a moment in your life when things may have changed for you (better or worse), when you made a realization, or when you experienced something unusual. Your story should include words and other media. If you produce a video or interactive media, you should also provide a complete script.</p>>
                <p>If you absolutely must, your writing can also be just words. But, in that instance, I'd like you to consider the design of your story. Think about typography and layout. Your story can be shared as pdf (if you use software like InDesign).  As always, be sure to spell and grammar check. Be thoughtful how you compose your stories.</p>
                <p><strong>The Catch</strong></p>
                <p>Your story should give others a surprising insight into who you are. It should give us a deeper impression of your character.</p>

                <p>In 2020 my husband and our two best friends (a couple) bought a house together because the rental company in Pullman had finally pissed us off so much that we decided it was time to stop renting. Our home is a 3 bedroom with one room on the main floor, and two rooms downstairs. There is also a studio apartment in the back with one small separate room off the kitchen. As of today, 9 people live in our household (meaning main house and studio apartment combined). We are not a commune, nor an intentional community but rather a large circle of close friends whose relation to each other spans continents. These are the stories of who these people are to me, and the home we share. </p>
                <img class="journal" src="375img/taras.jpg">
                <p><strong>Taras: </strong>Taras is my husband. We will be celebrating our 4th wedding anniversary on 12/13/2023. Taras and our relationship deserve a separate essay entirely. I will try to keep this short. I am utterly mad for this person and the reality-shifting beauty he has brought to my life. Getting to know him felt like waking up from a dream, or maybe realizing that dreams exist. He has introduced me to innumerable ideas, the most important of which has been a perspective of enduring optimism towards existence. Taras looks at all life as a bubbling milieu for the sake of itself and cheerfully examines as all of its cultures and ideas gurgling forth. He is curiosity personified with a healthy respect for the excavation of base truths, paradoxes, and the various ways to poke at them. He is serious but is easily tickled by the many jokesters he has collected and surrounded himself with over the years. I live to make this man laugh and smile. He has been one of my greatest mentors in love as only a lover can, but also in all its nuanced iterations as only the truest of friends will.</p>
                <img class="journal" src="375img/vlad.jpg">
                <p><strong>Vlad: </strong>Vlad and Taras are best friends, even if they don’t refer to each other much in these terms. They mostly refer to each other as “sister.” Vlad has a knack for and vested interest in understanding where the edges are, mathematically. This knack, or interest, or incessant obsession I think coincides nicely with Taras’ tendencies to poke at concepts. They can examine a topic together to exhausting lengths, down to a minutia which most might find unbearable (a fact they are aware and proud of). Vlad on his own though, exhausting as he maybe sometimes, is ultimately an exceptional communicator. He investigates so that he may have a totalizing understanding of any topic he finds interesting, unless of course such  investigations would be unwelcome. He is motivated by a desire for truth, to be adored, and to feel sure in himself; not in that order.</p>
                <img class="journal" src="375img/anna-edited-1.JPG">
                <p><strong>Anna: </strong>Anna is, for lack of a better term, my best friend, though is described as “wise person” in my phone contacts. Anna, like Vlad and Taras, is Ukrainian and was the first of our predominantly Ukrainian friend group to move to the US, about 13 years ago. She is also Taras’ ex-wife. Being friends with the two of them has deepened my understanding of human love and compassion by what feels like orders of magnitude. She is resilient and tough, but also soft and thoughtful, but also joyous and will instigate insatiable fun. She is a deeply creative person with a razor-sharp mind. She seeks new information every day with a standpoint rooted in secular humanist morals. She doesn’t think people change and has sturdy opinions, which I admire her for. We are very different but have found ourselves to be compliments of one another. </p>
                <img class="journal" src="375img/olya.jpg">
                <p><strong>Olya: </strong>Olya is Anna’s best friend. They have known each other since they were 12 and Anna is the god mother is Olya’s two daughters. Olya came here to live in our guest house with her girls in 2022 after the invasion of Ukraine escalated earlier that winter. Olya and I communicate less often than other people in the house because I have very little capacity to speak Ukrainian and her English is still rusty (though good, and far better than my Ukrainian). We have, however, managed to bond through sharing a home together. She has shared with me pieces of her upbringing and how hard it is to be away from her husband, Dmytro who was conscripted earlier this year and is now serving on the front lines of the war. She is not shy to admit her pain during these incredible challenges but maintains undeniable and sturdy composure. I admire her strength tremendously, not only in the midst of her own suffering, but all the while raising her children with conspicuous love and attunement to their experience.</p>
                <img class="journal" src="375img/solya.jpg">
                <p><strong>Solamia: </strong>Solya is Olya’s oldest daughter. She is 14 now and started 8th grade. Solya is very much a teenager, searching for herself, examining what she likes and dislikes. She goes to two schools, the American one, but also keeps up with her Ukrainian courses online. She also practices classical piano several times a week. I like hanging out with her because she reminds me of what it was like to be that age. It’s expansive to empathize with her daily struggles to become a young adult in the world, especially in the face of what I consider to be her unique circumstance. Despite her complaints about school, the world, being a teenager, she remains cheerful most days and is open about her experiences.</p>
                <img class="journal" src="375img/yasya.jpg">
                <p><strong>Yasya: </strong>Yasya is Olya’s youngest daughter of 5 years old. She is very cute and she knows it. I call her a demon, lovingly. One of the most incredible things to watch has been Yasya’s development, particularly that of her linguistic capacities. She speaks English the most natively out of the three of them. She seems to switch between the two languages with unimaginable ease. I have learned so much about the elasticity of children watching her grow over this past year. Having a small child in the house has changed my perception of time. It is going ever faster and I can see it in her the most. </p>
                <img class="journal" src="375img/evan.jpg">
                <p><strong>Evan: </strong>Evan is Anna’s husband. The four of us bought the house together. My relationship to Evan is so crystalline clear to me. He is my brother. An incredibly capable person, Evan is not only smart (graduating with his PhD this fall) but he is also very handy. He has rebuilt 4 boats and 2 cars since I started living with him in 2019. Integrity abounds as he (like Anna) holds consistent humanistic morals as a clear and guiding compass in his life. He is funny and like many in our group, very curious about how the universe works. We have fought many times about how something in the house should be handled, and this has fortified our friendship. We really know how to make each other laugh. We also know how to solve problems together well and I have learned an endless amount of hard and handy work from him. He is also Yasya's best friend.</p>
                <img class="journal" src="375img/taissa.jpg">
                <p><strong>Taissa: </strong>The newest member to our home is Taissa. She is the new baby of Anna and Evan, born at the end of November. I call her the joy machine because you can’t really experience anything but joy when you look at her. It really blows my mind to know that she is the result of combining the genetic makeup of two people I hold so dear. Our lives will never be the same now that she is in it, and this has brought me moments of awe. </p>
                <img class="journal" src="375img/home.jpg">
                <p>With the arrival of Taissa and Evan’s graduation, another chapter is ending. So many people not listed here have circulated through our dwelling, either to stay for a visit or to stay for a while. It’s a house which acts in this story as it’s own character, created by the relationships had within in it. It will once more take a new form in January when Anna, Evan, and Taissa move to Seattle. While this brings a myriad of complex emotions, joy and expansion dominate the landscape and atmosphere. We have lit our last Christmas tree as one home and don’t know when/if we will share a Christmas together as our families grow and move. The story of our home and of ourselves carries on though, however loosely or tightly connected. </p>

                <p>In class, we've spent a fair amount of time recently talking about how to engage readers.

                <p>I think the affect we experience from contemporary media is a layer of the awareness of our subjective experience. I think this subjective experience lens is a post-modernist framework as we abandon ideas of how we “should” be and rather notice what we are in a pursuit of truth (an accurate description of reality). Rather than taking on new ideas and checking them against a rigid moral framework, we consider our personal experience in and of the ideas.</p>
                <p>I think in the humanities education has adapted. It is from the humanities in which such a framework was developed. The humanities, by nature, is reactive to popularizations of cultural frameworks, potentially dangerously so.  Additionally, I think this same framework has exposed a shallowness of previously thought deep and sturdy research conducted in quantitative scientific fields. We are now aware of our ever-present inner subjectivity and capacity for interpretation. Data science is famous for it. Post-modernism did not answer modernism by dubbing it a failure. It broadened the horizons of possible truths which rendered some previously imagined boundaries of modernism obsolete.</p>
                <p>A mistake would be made to assume post-modernism (inclusive as it is) as right-minded. A facet of the framework is the idea of it’s-all-true vastness which renders all understandings and suppositions meaningless. Conflict becomes impossible which defeats any attempts at narrative creation, a tool in which our realities are anchored. If modernism is solid state, post-modernism is gaseous. </p>
                <p>Call me old fashioned, but I think we can turn to our known-cultural-motions map to consider ways we can better shape education today given where we have already been. As we move out of modernity, realize ourselves in post-modernity, the next step logical next step would be to design an education system rooted in meta-modernist terms. </p>
                <p>It’s truly hard to tell what I mean by this at this time, and I will continue to play with the concepts I’m baking up in this journal entry. Initial ideas would include an awareness of modernist and post-modernist modes being appropriate at different degrees in different settings. I have yearned for more rigidity in my curriculum, but it is hard to criticize the validating post-modernist approach many of my instructors have taken. I recognize that this subjective approach has quelled anxieties about whether I am doing a project right or wrong and that has been healing. I also recognized that as I develop as a designer and human, I crave more structured critique. If modernism is a solid-state, and pos-modernism is gaseous, what is the state of a meta-modern material? My first instinct is to answer “alive” which implies a permeable, malleable well defined structure as subject to change as everything else is. </p>

                <p>The internet has greatly diminished our societal need for distinguishing subcultures. It is limiting to subscribe one’s identity to a narrow genre of aesthetic, musical, or ideological taste. I think some small subcultures still exist, largely online. But they are not carried out in the meat space with clear identifying markers. That being said, I am part of <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/tpot-postrat">TPOT</a> on the site formerly known as Twitter. TPOT stands for “This Part Of Twitter” and consists of a smattering of rationalists, post-rationalists, burners (people who attend Burning Man), world-builders, effective altruists (EAs), post-EAs, enlightened tech bros, psychonauts, self-development excavators, and crypto-kids who made their money early in the Bitcoin game and now do some form of stage acting for fun. When I say I am part of it, I am a lurker. I read other people’s posts and go largely unnoticed. When I attended a meetup this summer at a small self-organized festival called “Vibecamp”, I was branded a Lemur, someone who gawks at conversations rather than participating in them. This was not as violent an accusation as it sounds. Basically what TPOT is up to is trying to live in truth, including that truth which post-modernism has brought about. It is hard to some up, but people show up to Twitter with their takes on anything which is pertinent to a healthy society, or pertinent to their personal health, mainly emotional and psychological; so just about anything. Everyone seems to do their best to show up to each discussion in good faith and there is high praise for defendable unpopular or even subversive opinions. It encapsulates a wide breadth of culture and is an international group. Leaning too far left or right or center politically is met with good faith challenge. I think people just don’t realize how many narratives they cling to day to day and TPOT is a group of people examining that in themselves each day. What it has done for me personally is given me a potent place where a bunch of smart people are sharing their research of a topic they are really into, be that anything from self-development to AI existential risk. A lot of incredibly smart people exist there who are just sharing their minds with not ulterior motive other than the thrill of learning and discussing. While it can be a terrifically subversive and counter-cultural place, it can also be incredibly connective.</p>

                <p>To investigate my relationship to social media, I decided to start at the beginning. My first social media was Myspace probably, around 2005. It was the first time I understood anything about web design tools like HTML. I really liked changing and updating my page in different color schemes and choosing new music to add to the atmosphere. I was 15 or so at the time, which is also a prime age for social development, I think. One of the features of Myspace was a ranked friend list which appeared on your page. This signaled who was who to whom. There was also a feature which allowed you to customize your username which was another way to flash aesthetic value and virtue signal, though I was not aware of all of this at the time. I wish I could remember exactly how Myspace faded out of fashion for me, but I cannot. My assumption is that other people I knew started using it less, so the social value disintegrated. Writing this investigation gave me cause to look into whether or not a simulator exists, and <a href="https://spacehey.com/profile?id=2043569">I found one</a>. Feel free to friend me.</p>
                <p>After that, around 2008, one of my friends forced me to get a Facebook profile. By force I mean she set my profile up for me while I laid on her bed not even looking at the computer and answering the profile questions like a personality quiz. At the time I had heard of Facebook but thought it was not open to general public, that it was only for university students. Carly was going to UNM, and I was finishing my senior year of high school. She told me the company had just announced that they were opening account access to the general population and were no longer requiring users to have university affiliated email addresses. It too was <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Facebook">pretty different</a> than what we see today. I remember not using it much at first because I didn’t find it to be as much fun. You can’t design your page? I also didn’t have a lot of friends who used it. What simple times.</p>
                <p>In 2010 I moved away, far away, to another continent. In those times I used Skype. It was new and exciting, and I used it a lot to keep in touch with my family and select few friends. But it was kinda too removed from everyone. You had to coordinate quite a lot a make a time to meet. This was when I really started using my Facebook more. It was also more popular with the European friends I was making. They would organize events like birthday parties and the information of where and when was all on Facebook.</p><video width="320" height="240" controls><source src="375img/fln36fd-vid-arabspring.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
                <p>A year later was when I got my first smart phone. It was a full screen with wireless data, and I could check the Facebook app while on public transport. This was before <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/01/the-psychology-of-your-scrolling-addiction">infinite scroll</a> was a feature though so you would always reach the end of the day’s events rather quickly. I think at this time my relationship to social media was pretty wholesome, partially because my feed was a more or less contained network of only people I knew. There were also no ads. </p>
                <p>In 2013 when I moved back to US, Facebook was a full-blown addiction, and I was using it to constantly keep in touch people. I used the chat function to stay connected to the people I had met abroad. The local art scene back home was organized on Facebook. Every house show, gallery opening, open mic night was advertised via events pages on Facebook. I think this is also around the time the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92yRb4vOun8">“social media manager”</a> as a job title started popping up more. Even the dive bar down the street had a Facebook page. </p>
                <p>This was also around the time I got an Instagram. Again, it was at the behest of one of my friends though this time I was more willing. It had been around for a while but for a long time was only available to iPhone users. By 2014 it didn’t matter though because I got my first iPhone, an iPhone 5. My first few posts on Instagram are pretty lack luster. I was trying to figure out I think what the platform was for. It operated so differently than Facebook. It was image based and that was very different than Myspace or Facebook at that time. Enjoy the first instgram post of Diane Keaton which I've included below.</p>
                <div><img class="journal" src="375img/dianekeaton.png"></div>
                <p>A couple years later, stuff was getting more interesting. I was posting little scenes, slices of my life. I think social media helped me realized my eyes as cameras and that the camera in my phone allowed me capture and share what I was seeing and the atmosphere there. The word <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etQ36X37dXo">“influencer”</a> was out there, shaping how everyone viewed social media and where it was going. It was around this time when I noticed that I was mindlessly opening the Facebook app on my phone. In response I deleted it. But the same was happening with Instagram.</p>
                <p>Over the next few years, I phased Facebook out almost entirely. I was living for IG though. Up until recently, this was the pattern. I watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaaC57tcci0">Social Dilemma</a> when it came out and it brought to my attention even more loudly to something I was already noticing. This thing was sucking my attention.</p>
                <p>My current relationship with social media can be broken into what I think is good, and what I think is bad. </p>
                <p>What I think is bad is the induced cultural crisis of psychological and emotional wellbeing in the following ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It has made evident the idea of people as <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/disrupting-data-governance-a-mozilla-guide-for-reshaping-the-data-economy/">commodities</a>. </li>
                        <li>induced <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35213943/">attention deficiencies</a> in people</li>
                        <li>a detachment from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3Xv_g3g-mA">community centered thought</a></li>
                        <li>escalated a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54l8_ewcOlY">crisis of meaning</a></li>
                        <li>deepened a pre-existing confusion between “being” and “having”</li>

                    </ul>
                <p>What I think is good about it:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li></li>It has democratized the sharing of information and has generated <a href="ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfgjoVCZwU">networks of cultural influence</a> the likes of which had never been seen before. </li>
                        <li>I think it has made some people, a fucking lot of people, feel less alone.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Start to finish, the social media journey brought me a lot of joy. Being a young adult in the throughs of such a powerful network emergence and having little to no idea of the breadth of that beast is exciting and I feel like a whole story can be written about that. What is the  most suitable character archetype to tell the story of someone living during immense social upheaval and technological development?</p>
                <p>As of now, I have an app on my phone which locks me out of Instagram during the weekdays so that I don’t get sucked in. The negatives outweigh the positives more and more. Maybe it’s my age. I’ve also resisted (wisely, in my opinion) getting a TikTok account. I feel myself wanting more and more to create things, not look at what other people are creating. It’s a shame because it is still a place to connect, but again, as I get older, the more I find myself maxed out by my relationships. I feel like I struggle to have enough time to myself and to put towards undirected play. Everything is so structured lately between school and work and my familial obligations, I find it hard to imagine social media being something that is truly feeding my soul. So I think what I’m saying is that I feel like I’m in a state of twilight with it. It’s not disappeared completely, but it’s on the back burner with great intention.</p>
                <p>The content included in this examination are meant as a passive commentary. This topic is huge, and the global discourse is entangled with so many other topics. I think my final and concise stance one my relationship to social media would be this: moderation. It all comes back to moderation so often. I think we are chasing a synthesis of existence to alleviate our own suffering. I think this will always come at cost though. You’ll notice my pro con list above has some topics which could be argued into the other side. Networks of cultural influence the likes of which have never been seen before could sway political leanings of a country that don’t justly represent its best interests. It also makes so much sense to want to connect and see what is out there in the big and beautiful world we live in. I think this can also easily become an escape. Maybe we should go back to the beginning, think about where it started, and reexamine our intentions day to day.

                <p>Prior to the development of writing systems, information-sharing and storytelling happened primarily through the spoken word. The advent of printing arguably facilitated the democratization of the written word but books could still be expensive items to own. In our time, media consumption can be expensive. For instance, going to a movie can end up costing $20-30 per person. Streaming media requires subscriptions and to get the stories we crave, we sometimes have to purchase multiple subscriptions.</p> 
                <p>Are our storytelling media now luxury items? Please address this question in your writing this week. Aim for an entry that is about 350-500 words. </p>
                <p>You might address:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The effects of mass adoption of subscriptions for media consumption</li>
                        <li>The history of how television, radio, games, and movies used to be distributed</li>

                <p>“The advent of printing arguably facilitated the democratization of the written word, but books could still be expensive items to own.” I would tweak this statement and say that printing facilitated the democratization and proliferation of information. The reason communication exists in the first place comes from a desire to share information. Printing is a tool of information sharing. As with many tools, I think there is a spectrum of efficiency and effectiveness. I can dig a larger hole faster with an excavator than I can manually with a shovel. </p>
                <p>Storytelling media are not exclusively now luxury items, as “storytelling media” is a broad category with a spectrum of tools which could fit inside of it. I would say that some of the tools on this spectrum do constitute luxury items for many. Elon Musk’s ability to capture and moderate and censor the biggest open forum in history is a luxury few can afford. Some mediums are luxury items depending on how we are constructing our definitions of wealth and luxury. For example, according to 
                <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$model$markers$mountain$data$filter$dimensions$geo$un_state:true;;;;&encoding$order$data$concept:null&constant=none;&direction=asc;&selected$data$filter$markers@=africa&=americas&=asia&=europe&=usa;;;;&facet_row$data$constant=none;;;;&billy$encoding$selected$data$;;;;;;&chart-type=mountain&url=v1" target="_blank">Gap Minder</a>, the United States population exists exclusively above the “extreme poverty” line. It can be assumed that this means most of the population (with exceptions especially as it pertains to rural indigenous communities) has access to the internet. Having a free Facebook, YouTube, or Twitter account on which to consume media is possible for most in this context, which would imply they are not luxury items. Expanding this question beyond American borders to populations in Africa, Asia, and South America changes the context of the definition of luxury and would probably qualify internet access as a luxury item, and the United States as a luxurious country.</p>
                <img class="journal" alt="a chart from Gap Minder depicting global income comparisons with the US portion highlighted" href="https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$model$markers$mountain$data$filter$dimensions$geo$un_state:true;;;;&encoding$order$data$concept:null&constant=none;&direction=asc;&selected$data$filter$markers@=africa&=americas&=asia&=europe&=usa;;;;&facet_row$data$constant=none;;;;&billy$encoding$selected$data$;;;;;;&chart-type=mountain&url=v1" src="375img/gapminder-income.png" target="_blank">
                <p>Honing this discussion in on just the US population, I think an information-privilege reinforcing feedback loop is likely occurring. Each platform now tends to offer a subscription version of their media. This creates a privilege of information among those with more resources, and information can lead to improved methods of resource collection. Often, time is a factor as well; those with subscriptions can access more information, earlier. If I want to watch a movie from Disney, I can probably find it on Disney+ by paying a monthly fee. If I can’t afford that, I can try to pirate it, or rent it for a one-time fee on Amazon which takes time and the cost of my time.</p>    
                <p>So, higher quality and more efficient information is possible for a price. If you’re unable to pay that price, some version of that information is probably out there, but the time and energy needed to find it comes at a higher cost; an excavator compared to a shovel.</p>
