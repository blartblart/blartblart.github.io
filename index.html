                <p>What is my responsibility to my relationship as I feel interest fluctuate from my partner? I see us as drifting towards our respective directions which don’t have much in common. 
                    Bringing up my heartbreak would likely be perceived as pain transference. He asks what I notice. I cannot be totally honest because our conversations would turn into a place of pain and we would drift further apart.It feels so inevitable. 
                    I answered your question of what do I notice (having a kid) and you changed the subject to remind me that Alesia might call me later today. 
                    Missing you is pain. Will we go on any more adventures together? Will you want to be with me and not just appease me? God please want to be with me. 
                </p>

            <h3 id="June 13, 2022">June 13, 2022 - Where and how to masturbate</h3>
                <p>Masturbate in a bubble bath listening to music that makes your inner world horny for life. Don't think about anyone. Focus on how it feels and how the music sounds.  
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih7YEC8A53w" target="_blank">xXXi_wud_nvrstøp_ÜXXx(Remix)</a> Careful though, the song you choose could become like a dinner bell.  
                </p>
            <h3 id="June 12, 2022">June 12, 2022 - Biology and minimizing self delusion</h3>
                <p>To handle what I’m feeling brings on a cold feeling in the back of my throat and slight headache. I want to have a child. I want to shepherd in the consciousness of a new human that I have given my body for. I want to give my body to someone. I want to give way to biology and the complexity of the forces within, rather than live in delusion that I could, in my limited imagination, provide myself with something greater to do in this life.  Is it greater ego centrism to challenge your body to the maximum capacity, or to imagine that I could do something greater, more worthwhile that I thought of myself? I wouldn’t dare to be so arrogant. 

                    I want to truly live for someone else, while knowing my ownness in this life. 
                    </p>
             <h3 id="June 12, 2022">June 09, 2022 - Review of Eccojams by Chuck Persons & other insights</h3>
                <p>Notes on Dan Lopatin’s early project <a href="https://archive.org/details/svhscr_protonmail_03A3" target="_blank">Eccojams</a> by Chuck Person. The pseudonym he chose is funny and stupid but aware. Something about this artist hits on the same notes that makes me lobe Ben Sinclair. Maybe it’s their shared cheesiness, or a tendency to tred in the slow. Slowness for me is indicative of living in the now. 
                        Side note that this could be and incompatibility of mine and Taras’. I think he is fast and I am slow and I think this sentiment has been repeated since the beginning of our relationship. 
                        It’s pleasant to hear and artist’s personal meditations (maybe too elaborate a word) on snippets from dreamy pop songs. He replays them over and over again, but not for the whole track. I can slip into a dreamscape be still be actively listening.
                        I must resist the urge to dive into the 90’s & 00’s pop hits skattered throughout. I was too busy trying to consume and have counter culture as a façade identity that I denied myself the honest American pop culture I truly adored. Was I pretentious as an 11 year old? Maybe? But unfoundedly. I just knew that I wanted to be like my brother and follow his punk/rocker values rather than indulge in whatever Elizabeth Colton had to offer in Disney Channel bedroom.

            <h3 id="May 31, 2022">May 31, 2022 - The freedom in the absence of you</h3>
                <p>It is freedom. It’s also an absence of someone. Some intimacy. Partnership is a tie, a priority. I cannot rely on you for this. You’ll go to Ukraine without me. You’ll go with this person, with whom you share this trauma, this culture. And I have the community. 

                        I want to be someone else’s great love. You are mine but I am not yours
                        You are my person, but I am not yours.
                </p>
            <h3 id="May 15, 2022">May 15, 2022 - My own mediocrity</h3>
                <p>To embrace my own mediocrity. To accept my lack of motivation. To be honest of what I am now and what I am likely to become. It is to embrace loneliness. I have to lower my own standards to accept myself. It feels like failure, but I don’t really even remember having a goal. I just gained some kind of big ego, but over what?

                    I don’t know what to do with myself when I’m not in school. I need someone to tell me what to do. I want a daddy. 
                    
                    I think I fill my void by bouncing myself into new social situations, and use whatever clout I could gather from the previous to impress (or trick) the one at hand. I make them think I’ve done something, that I am someone, based on the social situations I was lucky enough to find myself in from the previous group. 
                    
                    What do I want? What do I want from life? I don’t want to die because I’m not killing myself. This question of want is the one I must answer. 
                    
                    Proven fact: sitting around feeling sorry for yourself is not going to change anything.
                    
                    You’ve got to feel it. Everything. Every breeze. What is the vibe? Don’t be so afraid of the overstimulation. Take it. Take it in. Remember being overwhelmed? Bring it on. Leave your stillness. It’s ok to make mistakes. 
                    
                    This guy tonight was mediocre? I feel bad even saying it but it was the first word that came to mind. I’m not better than him so maybe I shouldn’t use this word.
