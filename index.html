                <p>What is my responsibility to my relationship as I feel interest fluctuate from my partner? I see us as drifting towards our respective directions which don’t have much in common. 
                    Bringing up my heartbreak would likely be perceived as pain transference. He asks what I notice. I cannot be totally honest because our conversations would turn into a place of pain and we would drift further apart.It feels so inevitable. 
                    I answered your question of what do I notice (having a kid) and you changed the subject to remind me that Alesia might call me later today. 
                    Missing you is pain. Will we go on any more adventures together? Will you want to be with me and not just appease me? God please want to be with me. 
                </p>

                <p>Masturbate in a bubble bath listening to music that makes your inner world horny for life. Don't think about anyone. Focus on how it feels and how the music sounds.
